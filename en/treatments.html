                    <p class="justify">Quality and personal attention are our focus. We therefore set clear boundaries between 
                        the treatments that may be performed by dentists, by specialists and by the dental hygienist or the 
                        prevention assistant. As a patient, you know what you can expect from us. Both dentists are general 
                        practitioners with a broad orientation. This means that you can come to us for all your usual oral care, 
                        such as oral hygiene, conservative dentistry (fillings, crowns, bridges), prosthetic dentistry 
                        (including dentures and frame prostheses), endodontics (root canal treatments), periodontics 
                        (treatment of gum disease).</p>

                    <p class="justify">You can also turn to us for affordable cosmetic and aesthetic dentistry.</p>

                    <p class="justify">We pay special attention to anxious patients and have a long experience with 
                        the treatment of this group.</p>

                    <p class="justify">Regular periodic dental check-ups are important for the health of your mouth. 
                        We will then discuss daily oral care with you so that your teeth and soft tissue of the mouth 
                        remain healthy. If necessary, we take action to improve oral hygiene.</p>

                    <p class="justify">If the dentist detects problems in your teeth, he or she will discuss with you 
                        whether additional treatment is necessary. The dentist also informs you about:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the number and duration of treatments</li>
                        <li>the expected results</li>
                        <li>the prognosis and the possible risks of the treatments</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="justify">Information about dental treatments can be found in the information about oral health 
                        on  <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.allesoverhetgebit.nl/">www.allesoverhetgebit.nl</a> (in Dutch only)</p>

                    <p class="justify">The dentist will immediately discuss minor procedures with you and the treatment will 
                        follow shortly if necessary. This is, for example, the case with simple dental cleaning or making 
                        a small filling. With more extensive treatments we inform you about the costs. If you wish, the 
                        treatment plan with the associated costs can be recorded in writing. Partly because of the legal 
                        obligation, we always do this for treatments that cost more than € 150. The relevant treatments are 
                        only carried out after your approval. This is generally possible within 15 working days.</p>


                    <p class="justify">If you have to undergo special treatment, you do not have to look for the specialist in 
                        question yourself. We can refer you to our colleagues for dental surgery, orthodontics, implantology, 
                        periodontology (gum disease), gnathology (specialists for the jaw joint), endodontology 
                        (specialists for root canal treatments) and maxillofacial prosthetics (special prostheses). 
                        We also work together with a well-equipped dental technician within walking distance 
                        of the practice so that repairs or extensions to prostheses can take place within one day.</p>

                    <p class="justify">We store the information about your teeth and the history of treatments in our computer. 
                        This system is, of course, well protected and backed up professionally every day. We keep the data 
                        for at least 15 years. At your (written) request, we can also send your data (electronically) to another 
                        practitioner.</p>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Regular checks</h2>

                    <p class="justify">In our dental practice, the prevention of dental problems has the highest priority. 
                        Prevention is simply better, easier and cheaper than cure. We are happy to ensure that your teeth 
                        are clean and your gums remain healthy.</p>

                    <h2>Prevention for children</h2>

                    <p class="justify">We strive for healthy teeth for all children! We therefore advise you to take your 
                        child to the dentist from the age of two when you go for a check-up yourself. Treatment is usually 
                        not necessary at this age. You mainly receive information and advice from the dentist or the 
                        prevention assistant. If you then have your child's teeth checked every six months, any problems 
                        can be identified and corrected in time.</p>

                    <p class="justify">We use sealing and fluoride to prevent caries and dental erosion. However, the most 
                        important thing is our cleaning instructions and nutritional advice. We give this not only to the 
                        little ones, but also to children who are undergoing the “orthodontic  treatment”, because it is 
                        always difficult to clean sufficiently between the braces.</p>

                    <h2>Oral hygiene</h2>

                    <p class="justify">We are happy to help you with the extra care of your teeth and gums. To this 
                        end, the dentist also examines the gums on the basis of the so-called DPSI score. For example, 
                        if you suffer from bleeding, inflamed and / or withdrawn gums, loose teeth and the DPSI score 
                        is 3 or higher, then you are probably suffering from periodontitis.</p>
                    <p class="justify">You can also come to us for the treatment of bad breath (halitosis).</p>
    

                    <h2>Periodontitis</h2>

                    <p class="justify">Periodontitis  can have several causes. A common cause is the presence of 
                        bacteria. If necessary, we can use a simple test to determine whether and, if so, which 
                        bacteria are present in the mouth. The treatment plan is drawn up and discussed with you 
                        on the basis of the test results. If necessary, we will send you to a specialist for gum 
                        disease (periodontist).</p>



                    <h2>Fillings</h2>

                    <p class="justify">In our practice we use high-quality composite filling materials in the 
                        color of the teeth. Advantages of the tooth-colored fillings are:</p>
                    <ol class="small-text">
                        <li>they are adapted to the color of the tooth and are therefore less noticeable than the 
                            gray amalgam fillings;</li>
                        <li>the tooth-colored filling material is stuck to the tooth or molar, so that not 
                            healthy parts of the tooth or molar need to be ground away unnecessarily (which is 
                            necessary for an amalgam filling);</li>
                        <li>the adhesive technique also ensures good adhesion of the filling to the tooth or molar, 
                            making it stronger.</li>
                    </ol>
                
        
                    <p class="justify">Tooth-colored fillings also have disadvantages. Not all tooth-colored fillings 
                        are as strong as amalgam and break down sooner. That is why they are sometimes not used for 
                        large fillings in the molars. Applying a tooth-colored filling is also more laborious than 
                        an amalgam filling. More actions are also needed for repairing teeth or molars with tooth-colored 
                        filling material. This takes more time, which entails higher costs. After applying a tooth-colored 
                        filling, the teeth may be more sensitive for some time, especially at the transition from warm to 
                        cold and vice versa or when the relevant teeth are loaded. That has to do with a tension between 
                        the filling material and the natural tooth or molar. The larger the filling, the more sensitive 
                        it can be.</p>

                    <h2>Crowns & bridges and implants</h2>

                    <p class="justify">In some cases it may be necessary for a tooth or molar to need a crown, for example 
                        if a filling becomes too large and no longer has a hold, or if a tooth or molar has previously 
                        had a root canal treatment and has therefore become too vulnerable, or sometimes for 
                        aesthetic reasons.</p>

                    <p class="justify">A crown is a kind of shell made from porcelain, zirconium or metal, or a combination 
                        of these materials. A crown protects a tooth or molar and gives it support and stability.</p>

                    <p class="justify">If one or more teeth are missing, a bridge can be a good choice to replace the missing 
                        elements. A bridge consists of at least two crowns (pillar) and one or more bridge intermediate 
                        parts (dummies) that are connected to each other. The dentist can use an x-ray to assess whether 
                        the pillar teeth are suitable for a bridge.</p>

                    <p class="justify">Another way to replace missing elements in your teeth is through an implant. The 
                        choice of a bridge or implant depends on a number of factors such as your general health condition, 
                        dental situation, bone level and personal preference. The available budget also plays a role.</p>

                    <p class="justify">If you need a cast restoration, make an appointment for a consultation. After 
                        anamnesis, X-ray, extensive examination and a personal interview, your wishes and possibilities are 
                        discussed by the dentist.</p>

                    <h2>Dentures</h2>

                    <p class="justify">You can contact us for both full and partial dental prostheses, including prostheses 
                        on implants and frame prostheses. For repairs and filling of prostheses, you can bring your teeth 
                        before 10:00 in the morning and it will be ready the same day later in the afternoon. For filling 
                        and for expansion and some repairs an impression must be taken.</p>

                    <h2>Extractions</h2>

                    <p class="justify">The pulling of teeth / molars and minor surgery can be done in our own practice. For 
                        more complex treatments you are referred to the dental surgeon or another specialist.</p>


                    <h2>Endodontics</h2>

                    <p class="justify">In our practice we regularly perform root canal treatments. These are also called 
                        channel or nerve treatment. During a root canal treatment, the dentist removes the inflamed tissue 
                        from the dental pulp.</p>

                    <p class="justify">The cause of the inflammation is caused by bacteria that have penetrated into your 
                        tooth and into the dental nerve (pulp) due to tooth decay, a leaking filling or a severe blow.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justify">Inflamed tooth tissue can no longer heal. It is an irreversible process. The inflamed 
                        tissue must be removed. To do this, your dentist first opens your tooth or molar and removes the 
                        inflamed tissue. He / she then cleans the canal with small files and rinses it with a disinfecting 
                        rinsing fluid. Finally, the canals are filled. Your dentist often takes one or more X-rays during 
                        treatment. This way he / she has good control over the course of the treatment.</p>    

                    <p class="justify">After the root canal treatment, your dentist will build your tooth or close again with a 
                        filling. If the tooth is weakened, a crown may be needed. A tooth or molar treated in this way 
                        can last for a long time.</p>    

                    <h2>Night guard / anti-grinding protection</h2>

                    <p class="justify">If you wake up in the morning with muscle pain in your jaws or if you have symptoms 
                        such as pain in the jaw joints and / or headache, it is quite possible that you will grind your teeth 
                        at night. Moreover, excessive movement of the teeth and molars at night results in wear of the teeth 
                        and toothache. This can be prevented by a night guard that is custom made for you.</p>

                    <h2>Sportguard</h2>
                    <p class="justify">We manufacture mouth guards for all kinds of sports, from kickboxing to hockey. In addition 
                        to the best protection, a custom-made protector also offers the best wearing comfort.</p>

                    <h2>Teeth whitening</h2>
                    <p class="justify">The huge range of bleaches and treatments is confusing. Many products promise beautiful white teeth, 
                        but unfortunately that is different in practice. An unsafe bleaching process can even damage your teeth. 
                        If you are considering a bleaching treatment, choose a safe and professional method, under the supervision 
                        of your dentist.</p>

                    <p class="justify">The legislation has changed since October 2012. As a result, effective bleaching treatment can only be 
                        prescribed by a dentist. Feel free to ask for advice on your next visit to the practice.</p>
